Life Pulse | Healthcare Center
Description
Life Pulse is a comprehensive healthcare web application designed to streamline and enhance the interaction between patients and healthcare providers. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), Life Pulse offers two distinct interfaces tailored for patients and administrators.

Patient Interface
Patients can easily browse through a list of available doctors categorized by departments, book appointments, and manage their bookings. The intuitive interface ensures a smooth and hassle-free experience, enabling patients to find the right healthcare provider quickly.

Admin Interface
Administrators have powerful tools at their disposal to manage the healthcare center effectively. They can register new doctors, update doctor profiles, and manage appointments. The admin interface is designed to be secure and user-friendly, ensuring that administrators can perform their tasks efficiently.

Key Features
Doctor Management: Admins can add, update, and remove doctors from the system.
Appointment Booking: Patients can book appointments with doctors based on their availability.
Department Filtering: Patients can filter doctors by their departments, ensuring they find the right specialist.
Secure Authentication: Both patients and admins have secure login mechanisms to protect their data.
Responsive Design: The application is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
